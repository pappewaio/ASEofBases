# ASEofBases: Allele Specific Expression method and pipeline for analysis

#### What is ASEofBases?
Biased allele expression, refers to the imbalanced expression of the two alleles in a diploid genome. Unequal transcription of alleles may occur due to cis-regulatory element variation or allele-specific epigenetic modifications.  Allelic imbalance may be incorrectly inferred due to technical variation inherent in RNA-Seq data, including read depth, reference mapping bias, and the overdispersion of reads. To correct for technical variation we develop a logistic regression model with a mixed effects approach to combine information regarding biased allele expression from many individuals in a population, and across multiple genes. Here we describe a new method for inferring allelic imbalance that combines information from multiple SNP sites within a transcribed unit, using a logistic regression model that explicitly models the effects of reference bias and SNP type biases. Additionally, by using a mixed effects approach the method also makes it possible to combine information from many individuals in a population for each gene and to test hypothesis regarding allelic imbalance in specific genes within and across populations.

#### Key features
- method model of allele-specific expression in single individuals  
- method model of allele-specific expression using "population data"

Additionally code includes simulations:
- simulations for modeling statistcal power for various read depth and various number of SNPs per gene 
- simulations for modeling SNP-wise binomial, binomial-based logistic regression, and binomial-based logistic regression correcting for the over dispersion of read counts.

### Step 1. Compile programs/code to be executable
Getliners - Merge the tmp.keys (positions) with tmp.het (heterozygous protein coding SNPs for individual) and greps the set of keys in tmp.keys in column 2 of the file tmp.het

ieatgor - Filter for alignability output chr$chr.ind$ind.data, greps any entry in tmp.data that has chromosome and position within the regions and specified in the "targetfile" (regions of the genome that are "callable")

VCFmergeGTF - This code is merging the genotype calls (from vcf) with position of protein coding genes (from gencode)

		cd 2_prog/
		g++ -O3 -o VCFmergeGTF3 VCFmergeGTF3.cpp -lz
		g++ -O3 -o ieatgor ieatgorV2.cpp -lz
		g++ -O3 -o getliners getliners.cpp -lz

### Step 2. Program check
Make sure each of these programs are installed and added to the /ASEofBases/2_prog/ directory

### 3. Download Mapability file for filtering for uniqueness of the reference genome from ENCODE 
The mapability file is used for identifing uniqueness of the reference GRCh37/hg19 genome assembly. Mapability files were generated using different window sizes, high signal will be found in areas where the sequence is unique.

Download the Mapability file:
	
		wget http://hgdownload-test.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign50mer.bigWig
		mv wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign50mer.bigWig /ASEofBases/2_prog/BigWig/

### 4. Get raw data and conduct initial parsing
1_getRaw.sh is a bash script for downloading initial data and does some processing. 
- 1_getRaw.sh Overview:
	1. Convert Mapability file to bed format and create file to filter on mapability
	2. Get protein coding gene annotations
	3. Download & parse individual genotype information from `1000Genomes` individuals
	4. Download & parse individual information RNAseq data from `Geuvadis`

			sh /ASEofBases/bash_scripts/1_getRaw.sh


- Outputs:
	1. **chr#.50mer.target** - target file to individual chromosome files. Example: chr1:10207-10212
	2. **gencode.chr#.gore** - protein coding gene entries. Example: chr1	69091	70008	gene_id "ENSG00000186092.4"; 
	3. **gencode.protien_coding.genes.v19.gtf** - gencode gene annotation file, containing only protein coding regions 
	4. **chr#.genotypes.vcf** - 1000Genomes genotype file
	5. **individual_ID_list** -  Geuvadis RNAseq individual id list

## 5. Parse and merge genotype and transcriptome data
This bash script will call another script and together will conduct filtering and parsing of the genotype and RNAseq data.

		sh /ASEofBases/1_code/2_run.sh # this program runs 3_makeData.sh

- Output: will result in a file for each individual with these columns:
	1. chr: chromosome 
	2. pos: position
	3. ref: reference allele
	4. alt: alternative allele
	5. g: gene
	6. a1: observed phased allele 1
	7. a2: observed phased allele 2
	8. type: snp type (1 if allele 1 is the alternative allele and 2 if allele 2 is the alternative allele)
	9. n: total counts of reads overlapping
	10. nA: counts of As
	11. nC: counts of Cs
	12. nG: counts of Gs
	13. nT: counts of Ts
